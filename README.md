# CvcHelper 1.8.9
A forge mod that provides a few simple quality-of-life functions for _Cops and Crims_ games on the [Hypixel](hypixel.net) Minecraft server.

Current version 1.4 of the mod tracks your killstreaks per weapon during games, and notifies you when the firebomb or grenade can be reselected from the TDM shop after being used.

Where streak messages are displayed can be customized by pressing the __H__ key in game (this keybind is customizable under Minecraft's "Options" > "Controls" menu). Modules can be disabled through the mod configuration file, or by using the config GUI in game. The default hotkey to open the GUI is __J__ (this keybind is also customizable).

_Release 1.4 for Forge 1.8.9 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Scribee/CvcHelper/releases/download/v1.4/cvchelper-1.4.jar)!_
