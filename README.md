# CvcHelper 1.8.9
A forge mod that provides a few simple quality-of-life functions for _Cops and Crims_ games on the [Hypixel](hypixel.net) Minecraft server.

Currently, version 1.1 of the mod simply tracks your killstreaks per weapon during games.

Where these streak messages are displayed can be customized by pressing the __H__ key in game (this keybind is customizable under Minecraft's "Options" > "Controls" menu).

_Release 1.1 for Forge 1.8.9 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Scribee/CvcHelper/releases/download/v1.1/cvchelper-1.1.jar)!_
