# CvcHelper 1.8.9
A forge mod that provides a few simple quality-of-life functions for _Cops and Crims_ games on the [Hypixel](hypixel.net) Minecraft server.

Current version 1.2 of the mod tracks your killstreaks per weapon during games, and notifies you when the grenade can be reselected from the TDM shop.

Where streak messages are displayed can be customized by pressing the __H__ key in game (this keybind is customizable under Minecraft's "Options" > "Controls" menu).

_Release 1.2 for Forge 1.8.9 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Scribee/CvcHelper/releases/download/v1.2/cvchelper-1.2.jar)!_

### TODO:
* Reorganize code to make future modules simpler to implement
* Add config GUI
	* options for turning off modules
	* customizable text colors
* Add firebomb cooldown module
* Add an achievement progress tracker
* Get player's total stats and update in real time (?)
